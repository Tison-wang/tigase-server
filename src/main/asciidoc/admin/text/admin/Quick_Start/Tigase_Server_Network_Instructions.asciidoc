:version: v1.0, May 2016: Reformatted for v8.0.0.

One you have installed Tigase XMPP Server on a machine, you're going to want to use it. If you are just using for local communications on a network behind a router, you're all set. Enjoy and use!

However, if you want to have people from other computers outside your network connect to your server, you're going to have to go through a few more steps to show your server out to the public.

NOTE: This guide is merely a recommendation of how to get a local server to be open to incoming communications. Any time you open ports, or take other security measures you risk compromising your network security. These are only recommendations, and may not be appropriate for all installations. Please consult your IT Security expert for securing your own installation.

XMPP, being a decentralized communication method, relies on proper DNS records to figure out where and how an XMPP server is setup. Operating an XMPP Server will require you to properly setup DNS routing so not only can clients connect to you, but if you decide to run a federated server and enable server to server communication, you will need to do the same. If you already have a DNS server already, you should have little issue adding these records.
If you do not have a DNS setup pointing to your server, you may use a free dynamic name service such as dynu.com.

== A Records
You will not be able to use an IP Address or a CNAME record to setup an XMPP Server. While it's not required, an A record can provide some other benefits such serving as a backup in case the SRV record is not configured right.

== SRV Records
You will need to set SRV records both for client-to-server (c2s) communication and, if you plan to use it, server to server (s2s) communication. We recommend both records are entered for every server as some resources or clients will check for both records.
For this example we will use tigase.org is our domain, and xmpp as the xmpp server subdomain.

SRV records have the following form:

[source]
----
_service._protocol.name. TTL class SRV Priority weight port target.
----

The key is as follows:

* `service`: is the symbolic name of the desired service, in this case it would be _xmpp-client_ or _xmpp-server_.
* `protocol`: is the transport protocol, either TCP or UDP, XMPP traffic will take place over _TCP_.
* `name`: the domain name where the server resides, in this case _tigase.org_.
* `TTL`: a numeric value for DNS time to live in milliseconds, by default use _86400_.
* `class`: DNS class field, this is always _IN_.
* `priority`: the priority of the target host with lower numbers being higher priority. Since we are not setting up multiple SRV records, we can use _0_.
* `weight`: the relative weight for records with the same priority. We can use _5_.
* `port`: the specific TCP or UDP port where the service can be found. In this case it will be _5222_ or _5269_.
* `target`: the hostname of the machine providing the service, here we will use _xmpp.tigase.org_.

For our example server, the SRV records will then look like this:

[source]
----
_xmpp-client._TCP.tigase.org 86400 IN SRV 0 5 5222 xmpp.tigase.org
_xmpp-server._TCP.tigase.org 86400 IN SRV 0 5 5269 xmpp.tigase.org
----

=== Tigase and Vhosts
If you are running multiple vhosts or subdomains that you wish to separate, you will need another record. In this case an A record will be all you need if you are using default ports. If you are using custom ports, you will need to have a new SRV record for each subdomain.

== Hosting VIA Tigase.me
If you don't want to do all the hosting yourself, you can still have an XMPP service running in your own domain. The only condition right now is that this must be a DNS registered domain and DNS must point to the following DNS address: `tigase.me`. Please note, do not confuse it with tigase.im domain name.

Although SRV records are required by the XMPP specifications we do not require SRV records either. If you want to register: *your-domain.tld* on our XMPP service make sure that either the command:
[source,sh]
-----
$ host your-domain.tld
your-domain.tld has address x.x.x.x
-----

This displays `x.x.x.x` IP address associated to your DNS domain or commands:

[source,sh]
-----
$ host -t SRV _xmpp-server._tcp.your-domain.tld
_xmpp-server._tcp.your-domain.tld has SRV record 10 0 5269 tigase.me.
$ host -t SRV _xmpp-client._tcp.your-domain.tld
_xmpp-client._tcp.your-domain.tld has SRV record 10 0 5222 tigase.me.
-----

This displays `tigase.me` DNS name. We *strongly* recommend not to use the IP address directly however, as if the service grows too much, it will be much easier for us to migrate and expand it using the DNS name rather then IP address.

If you want to have MUC and PubSub available under your domain as subdomains, you have to setup DNS for your `muc.your-domain.tld` and `pubsub.your-domain.tld` domains too.

For MUC:

[source,sh]
-----
$ host -t SRV _xmpp-server._tcp.muc.your-domain.tld
_xmpp-server._tcp.muc.your-domain.tld has SRV record 10 0 5269 tigase.me.
$ host -t SRV _xmpp-client._tcp.muc.your-domain.tld
_xmpp-client._tcp.muc.your-domain.tld has SRV record 10 0 5222 tigase.me.
-----

For PubSub :

[source,sh]
-----
$ host -t SRV _xmpp-server._tcp.pubsub.your-domain.tld
_xmpp-server._tcp.pubsub.your-domain.tld has SRV record 10 0 5269 tigase.me.
$ host -t SRV _xmpp-client._tcp.pubsub.your-domain.tld
_xmpp-client._tcp.pubsub.your-domain.tld has SRV record 10 0 5222 tigase.me.
-----

Now, how do you register your domain with our service?

There are a few ways. We recommend checking with the xref:xref:addManageDomain[Add and Manage Domains] section of the documentation on setting that up. If you cannot or don't want to do it on your own, the way described in the guide please send us a message, either via XMPP to admin@tigase.im or the contact form requesting new domain. User registration is available via in-band registration protocol. You can also specify whether you want to allow anonymous authentication to be available for your domain and you can specify maximum number of users for your domain.

== Checking setup

If you have a cell phone on a separate network with an XMPP client, you can now try to login to test the server. If that is not handy, you can use an online tool to check proper DNS records such as kingant's: link:https://kingant.net/check_xmpp_dns/[https://kingant.net/check_xmpp_dns/] and it will tell you if anything is missing.

== Ports description
Once your server is setup, you may need to open at least two ports. By default XMPP communication happens on ports 5222/5269, to which point SRV records. Other ports used by the server are:

* `3478` (TURN or STUN, plain socket, TCP and UDP)
* `5349` (TURN or STUN, over TLS, TCP and UDP)
* `5222` (default XMPP socket port)
* `5223` (legacy XMPP socket port)
* `5269` (default s2s port, i.e.: federation support)
* `5277` (component protocol port, e.g.: for external components)
* `5280` (default BOSH port)
* `5290` (default WebSocket port)
* `8080` (HTTP API component port)
* `9050` (JMX Monitoring)

If for any reason you can't use default ports and have to change them it's possible to point SRV records those ports. Please keep in mind, that you have to open those ports for incoming connections in your firewall. In case you are using `iptables` you can use following command to include those ports in your rules:
[source,bash]
-----
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 5222 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 5223 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 5269 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 5277 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 5280 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 5290 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 9050 -j ACCEPT
-----

Both ports should be setup to use TCP only. If for any reason you want to make service available for different ports you can:

. change ports in Tigase configuration and update DNS SRV records;
. forward those ports to default Tigase ports (this is especially useful under *nix operating system if you want to utilize ports lower than `1024` while running, as recommended, Tigase service from user account - there is a limitation and user accounts can bind to ports lower than `1024`), for example using `iptables` rules (in following example we are making available Tigase SSL websocket port available under port `443`, which is usually opened in corporate firewalls):
+
[source,bash]
-----
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 5291
