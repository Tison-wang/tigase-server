*Description:* The `debug` property is used to turn on the debug log for the specified Tigase package. For example if you want to turn debug logs on for the `tigase.server` package, then you have to use the `server` parameter. If you have any problems with your server the best way to get help from the Tigase team is to generate configuration with this enabled at a minimum and run the server. Then from the `logs/tigase-console.log` log file I can provide the best information for us to provide assistance. More details about server logging and adjusting logging level is described in the Debugging Tigase article in the admin guide.
If you wish to debug packages not compiled with Tigase, use the xref:debugPackages[debug-packages] setting.

*Default value:* 'none'

*Example:* `debug = [ 'server', 'xmpp.impl' ]`

*Possible values:* Comma separated list of Tigase's package names.

*Available since:* 2.0.0
