*Default value:* `false`

*Example:* `'vhost-disable-dns-check' = 'true'`

*Possible values:* `true|false`

*Description:* This property disables DNS validation when adding or editing vhosts in Tigase server. This also exempts administrative accounts from validation.
With this property enabled, you will not benefit from seeing if proper SRV records are set so other people can connect to specific vhosts from outside your network.

This is a global property which is overridden by settings for particular vhost.
