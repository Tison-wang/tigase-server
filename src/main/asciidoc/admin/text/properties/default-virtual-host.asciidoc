:version: v2.1 June 2018: Reformatted for Kernel/DSL

*Description:* The `default-virtual-host` property allows setting of the name of default virtual host that is served by the installation. It is loaded during startup of the application and stored in the database. *It may only contain single domain name!*

Any additional configuration options or additional virtual hosts domains should be added and configured using ad-hoc commands such as `Add new item`, `Update item configuration` and `Remove an item` available at the JID of the `VHostManager` component of your installation (`vhost-man@your-server-domain`).

*Available since:* 8.0.0
