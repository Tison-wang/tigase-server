= cluster-mode

:version: v2.1, June 2017: Reformatted for Kernel/DSL

*Description:* The property is used to switch cluster mode on. The default value is `false` so you can normally skip the parameter if you don't want the server to run in cluster mode.
You can run the server in the cluster mode even if there is only one node running. The performance impact is insignificant and you will have the opportunity to connect mode cluster nodes at any time without restarting the server.

*Default value:* `false`  Tigase by default does not run in clustered mode.

*Example:* `'cluster-mode' = 'true'`

*Possible values:* `true|false`

*Available since:* 8.0.0
