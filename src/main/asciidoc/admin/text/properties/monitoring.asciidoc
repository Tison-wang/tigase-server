*Description:* This property activates monitoring interfaces through selected protocols on selected TCP/IP port numbers. For more details please refer to the xref:serverMonitoring[monitoring guide] in the user guide for details.
Each monitoring protocol should be called in it's own child bean under `monitoring ()`. If a protocol is not specified, monitoring under that will not be available.

*Default value:* By default monitoring is disabled.

*Example:*
[source,dsl]
-----
monitoring () {
    http () {
        port = '9080'
    }
    jmx () {
        port = '9050'
    }
    snmp () {
        port = '9060'
    }
}
-----

WARNING: DO NOT CONFUSE monitoring with monitor component.

*Possible values:* 'list of monitoring protocols with port numbers.'

*Available since:* 8.0.0
