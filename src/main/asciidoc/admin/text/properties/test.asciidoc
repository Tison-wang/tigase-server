:version: v2.1, August 2017: Reformatted for Kernel/DSL

*Default value:* By default test mode is disabled.

*Description:* This property sets the server for test mode, which means that all logging is turned off, offline message storage is off, and possibly some other changes to the system configuration are being made.

The idea behind this mode is to test Tigase XMPP Server with minimal performance impact from environment such as hard drive, database and others...

Test function has been replaced by the following setting:

[source,dsl]
-----
logging {
    rootLevel = 'WARNING'
}
-----

*Available since:* 8.0.0
